I'm a junior `full-stack developer` with a strong focus on `Java`. In addition to my full stack development skills, I've a strong interest in `data analytics` and `cloud engineering`. I'm currently preparing for the `AWS Certified Developer - Associate certification` as I seek to expand my knowledge and capabilities in these areas. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I'm eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a team or organization.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest technology trends and exploring new tools and frameworks. Overall, I am a motivated and enthusiastic learner, always looking for ways to improve and make a positive impact in the tech industry.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently:
-  improving Salt's Graduation Project called [HireMe](https://skillsondemand-production.up.railway.app/gallery?location=Stockholm,%20Sweden&service=) (repository: [skillsondemand](https://github.com/omgshalihin/skillsondemand))
-  learning/preparing for [AWS Developer - Associate Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/)

## âš¡ Fun personal project:
- hackday project called [Evently Social](https://event-management-frontend-production.up.railway.app/) to address the needs of users wanting to `attend an event with a friend`. (repository: [event-management-frontend](https://github.com/omgshalihin/event-management-frontend))
 
## ðŸŒ± Seeking to expand knowledge in:
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- TypeScript
