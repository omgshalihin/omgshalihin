I'm a `full-stack developer` with a strong focus on `Java`. In addition to my full stack development skills, I've a strong interest in `data analytics` and `cloud engineering`. I'm currently preparing for the `AWS Certified Developer - Associate certification` as I seek to expand my knowledge and capabilities in these areas. I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I'm eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a team or organization.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest technology trends and exploring new tools and frameworks. Overall, I'm a motivated and enthusiastic learner, always looking for ways to improve and make a positive impact in the tech industry.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m Currently:
- Improving Salt's graduation project called [HireMe](https://skillsondemand-production.up.railway.app/gallery?location=Stockholm,%20Sweden&service=) (repository: [skillsondemand](https://github.com/omgshalihin/skillsondemand)).
- Learning / preparing for [AWS Developer - Associate Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) (repository: [aws-dev-code](https://github.com/omgshalihin/aws-dev-code)).
- Learn to deploy serverless functions to any platform using Spring Cloud Function (repository: [severless-spring-cloud-function](https://github.com/omgshalihin/severless-spring-cloud-function)).

## âš¡ Fun Personal Project:
- Hackday project called [Evently Social](https://event-management-frontend-production.up.railway.app/) to address the needs of users wanting to `attend an event with a friend` (repository: [event-management-frontend](https://github.com/omgshalihin/event-management-frontend)).
